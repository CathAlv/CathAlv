# Catherine AM  
## _Aspiring Developer | Code Explorer | Creativity Meets Technology_

Hi! I’m **Catherine AM**, a passionate student diving deep into the world of multiplatform app development. Based near the beautiful city of Valencia, Spain, I’m on a journey to learn, create, and grow as a developer.

- 💻 **Tech Stack:** Java, Kotlin, and still getting the hang of Python (but I’m on it!)  
- 🔍 **Current Focus:** Multiplatform applications and exploring new ways to build meaningful software  
- 🎯 **Goals:** Transform ideas into real-world applications, grow my coding skills, and collaborate with other passionate developers

## What I Do

- 🌱 **Learning by Building:** I’m always working on new projects—whether it's a fun app or a class assignment, I take every opportunity to apply what I’ve learned and push myself further.  
- 🔧 **Experimenting:** I love experimenting with new technologies and tools to see how they fit into creative solutions.  
- 💡 **Sharing & Connecting:** I’m here to share ideas, collaborate on cool projects, and learn from the amazing GitHub community.

## Fun Facts

- I believe programming is a bit like art—it’s all about turning imagination into something real. 🎨  
- When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me brainstorming new ideas, or diving into side projects.

Feel free to check out my repositories, give feedback, or just say hi! Let’s connect and build something amazing together. 🚀
